## What Makes JavaScript Important?

--
### Atwood's Law
Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript. *- Jeff Atwood, Coding Horror*

--
### Why?

--
### Principle of Least Power
Rather than choose the most powerful solution to a problem, pick the least powerful solution

Note: TODO - what is this about?

--
### Bringing it all back
What makes JavaScript important?

--
### JavaScript is a simple language
- easy to learn
- easy to be productive in after a short amount of time
- easy to build just about anything with

--
### Why do you want to learn JavaScript?

---

---

## What is JavaScript?
### You tell me...

Take 2-3 mins and write down everything you know about JavaScript.

---

## History of JavaScript

--

### 1995
- Brendan Eich, Netscape (1995)
- general idea was to bring interactivity to web pages
- Eich puts together a proof of concept that becomes part of Netscape
- Pulled a bunch of features from languages that he liked
  - syntax comes from C
  - object-first and loose typing came from Scheme
  - Prototypal Inheritance came from Self
- mix between functional programming and object-oriented programming

Note:
 - FIXME: Verify syntax comes from C

--

### 1996
- Netscape was able to capture a majority of the browser market share in just 2 years; they were super aggressive about growth
- Microsoft launches JScript, an extremely high fidelity clone of JavaScript
- One of the first tipping points in the development and success of javascript
- Even copied in some of the languages bugs and quirks

--

### 1998
- Netscape retains control of the language but now they're fighting with Microsoft about it
- shop the language around to standards organizations, to create a standard for the language
- Microsoft takes over the committee and refuses to allow any changes to become part of the standard
- ECMAScript

--

### 1999
- 3rd edition of the language is agreed upon
- Then something amazing happens for the language: nothing.
- For I kid you not 10 years, there is no new spec, new additions or changes to the language, nothing is fixed, nothing.

--

### 2009
- nothing happens for 10 years
- gives JS the chance to build an incredible market share
- leads to incredibly wide cross-browser support

--

### 2000
- version 4 is scraped

Note:
- FIXME: Why was it scrapped?

--

### 2005
- AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML becomes mainstream
- lets us pull data from somewhere else using JavaScript and update the contents of the page based on that data
- browsers become stable/powerful enough to support applications

--

### 2007
- JavaScript becomes the most popular language in the world
- jQuery is created

--

### 2008
- Google comes out with something called V8 - an extremely efficient and fast JavaScript engine which makes JS almost as fast as regular C++

--

### 2009
- 5th edition of the language is agreed upon
- Node.js is released - lets us use JS on servers
- PhoneGap is released - lets us use JS to create mobile applications
- Ecosystem really kicks in

--

### And since 2009...
- ES2015 (aka ES6) released
 - Lots of requested features added to the language
 - JavaScript feels far more mature
- ES2016 released
- ES2017 soon to be released
